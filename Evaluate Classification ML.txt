How to evaluate your machine learning classification model? Python has precision and recall and R has sensitivity and specificity. Then there is confusion matrix. Ok confused enough? I'll explain it intuitively below!

Confusion matrix is made to make you less confused but end up making you confused :/

Anyways, you need 2 pieces of information:
-Classes. This is generally [positive, negative] but it can be [small, medium, big] depending on the classes of your classification problem
-Predicted vs. actual axis

For each class, you want to maximize the count where predicted=actual

"""Focus on ACTUAL"""

If you have 100 REAL news, how many of them have you identified? Hitting all your real target?
True positive rate = sensitivity =  RECALL (for positive)

If you have 100 FAKE news, how many of them have you identified? Hitting all your fake target?
True negative rate = specificity = RECALL (for negative)

"""Focus on PREDICTION"""

When you PREDICTED 100 real news, how many of them are actually real? How reliable is your prediction for real news?
Positive predictive value = PRECISION (for positive)

When you PREDICTED 100 fake news, how many of them are actually fake? How reliable is your prediction for fake news?
Negative predictive value = PRECISION (for negative)
