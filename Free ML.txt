In the past weeks, I have collected materials for some #DataScience topics (mostly free). Thanks to my friends who gave me these suggestions. Here is the collection of those collections:

- Machine learning: https://lnkd.in/e4ij_is
- Natural language processing: https://lnkd.in/etbXrqv
- Bayesian statistics: https://lnkd.in/eprtxDg
- Time series: https://lnkd.in/euKHC6X
- Neural networks: https://lnkd.in/dpYHQTi
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): https://lnkd.in/eYp532G
- Interview questions: https://lnkd.in/dSfgZDs
- Comparing ML models: https://lnkd.in/et6aNJv

For the future a few weeks, I plan to have a schedule like this:

- Morning - Leetcode: https://lnkd.in/en__DmN
- Afternoon - CMU 10-701: https://lnkd.in/egY9KfD
